         <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the
            Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your
            exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount
            actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased
            anything through the Service.
            <br>
            <br>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the
            Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or
            consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for
            loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption,
            for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to

            provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised
            of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its
            essential purpose.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of
            liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of
            the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability
            will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
         </p>
         
         <h3>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h3>
         <p>The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults

            otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of
            merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement,
            and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance,
            usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company
            provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind
            that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be
            compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services,
            operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or
            be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.
            <br>
            <br>
            Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's
               provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied:
               (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information,
               content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service
               will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or
               currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv)

               of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware,
               timebombs or other harmful components.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties
            or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of
            the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case
            the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to
            the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
         </p>

            In no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special,
            incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever arising out of or in
            connection with your access or use or inability to access or use the Service.

         <h3>Severability & Waiver</h3>
         <h4>Severability</h4>
         <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such

            remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
         </p>
         <h4>Waiver</h4>
         <p>
            Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require
            performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not effect a party's
            ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time
            thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any
            subsequent breach.
